# checkVT
checkVT (check VirusTotal) is an open source project for an independent research class.

Plan is to create a simple web browser extension that takes users URLs submitted via right-click and sends them directly to be checked against all engines on VirusTotal with an added feature that VirusTotal doesn't have.

Alternatively, users can use the web-based version to manually submit URLs: http://checkvt.epizy.com/

### There are a few ways to do this process:
1. Using the browser extension with the VirusTotal [API](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference), we would need users to create their own VirusTotal account in order to have their own API key to be used on their browser sending the requests. This would allow a max of 4 requests per minute, which is fine for most people who dont need to scan every single link they get or feel like checking.
2. Using the browser extension without the API and instead using the GUI, it will simply open up a tab on their current browser and automatically plug in the URL domain they selected into the checkVT search/process field after it has been processed by the php/curl function. This is much simpler and does not require users to sign up for the account which removes a barrier for users who do not want to create any account at all.
3. Using a web-app running php on the backend, we simply let users manually enter the URLs for processing which performs the extra effective URL action that VirusTotal does not do, which essentially means that if the HTTP headers or redirects on the website have a final destination (which malicious URLs usually do), this sends whichever final destination URL it was able to find to be checked on VT.



### Limitations:
- When you use the checkVT browser extension or the web-app, it essentially parses links checking for redirects along the way and uses sha256 hash to create the unique ID of this URL that VirusTotal looks for in their database. The way the VirusTotal system works is that if you submit a URL (which gets converted into its sha256 hash form) and their database does not have a record for this hash being analyzed, it returns the "Item not found" error. The problem here is that a hash is unique and any single character difference in the source will create a completely unique and different hash. So for example if you wanted to submit the URL `http://www.somewebsite.com/user1`, but their system has a record for `http://www.somewebsite.com/user2`, you will get an error because the sha256 hash of `http://www.somewebsite.com/user1` is `4806811b6407cbd545d753d87294889ac537042f4a21c813cba30219acdbf23a` and that of `http://www.somewebsite.com/user2` is `9d2fb06b5f64b4faa8da5e7b27c778c9fa182b1bc2ec3ddecf87ea7bfd3e8425`. As you can see, completely different just by changing user1 to user2.

- Since the checkVT process relies on VirusTotal having the URL already analyzed and we sometimes get an "Item not found" error as explained above, I thought that the best way to reach a balance with this issue would be to only submit the link's hostname/domain, and not everything that goes after it. By choosing this method, we reduce the chances of almost always getting an "Item not found" (URL not analyzed) error, and you still get to see if the domain of the website you are about to click on is potentially unsafe or suspicious.

- There is a very simple but effective way that some malicious websites hide the final destination URL they want you to land on, which `cURL` cannot retrieve, and that is the use of the javascript `<script>document.location.href` method. By using this method on their website, they essentially bypass the one aspect that `cURL` is good for, which is being able get HTTP headers, check, navigate to redirects, and view source code of websites without actually running javascript code on your machine. Javascript is one of the major ways malware, ransomware, viruses, and other malicious code finds its way onto your machine.

- Some phishing happens by combining URL shortners and unusually formatted links, which they use to hide the malware file, for example `data:text/html,<script>window.location.href='https://bit.ly/3fNdafO';</script>` this whole line can be used as an href in HTML and since it does not directly begin with the HTTP/S protocol, most services don't recognize it as an actual URL. If you test that text by inserting it into your browser, it should send your browser to `https://cdn.example.com/somedir/badfile.js`.
